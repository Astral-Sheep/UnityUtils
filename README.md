## This project will contain tools to help people programming with Unity C#.

Installation:

- drag and drop the .dll file in your project (I recommend to create a folder "libs" in the project)

- let Unity do its weird things

It's now installed in your project :)

## I will most likely not add anything anymore since I don't have time to work on it
